## Build Log

### Build Log 1 (completed): v62, carried over from the handoff doc
Everything that shipped in v62 before this repo existed. Recorded from the handoff doc, not from a live build.
- [x] Landmarks: Arlington Cemetery (🪦) and Dollywood (🦋)
- [x] Home location POI
- [x] Heading freeze at 2 knots or below
- [x] 12 state season-date fixes
- [x] Removed the main-map runway lines and the diagnostic displays
- [x] Automatic cutscene trigger disabled
- [x] Binary Overview/Follow popup camera
- [x] Auto-open at 1 nm, with a 9 nm / 20-minute re-arm

**Verification:** not recorded in the handoff doc.

### Build Log 2 (completed): Split index.html into CSS and JS files
The app lived in one 12,169-line `index.html` (committed as-is first, `7922da0`). Split into separate files, with no code changes.
- [x] `css/styles.css`: the inline style block
- [x] `js/early-gps.js`, `js/loader.js`, `js/drawers.js`, `js/state.js`: the small early scripts and global app state
- [x] `js/data/map-data.js` and `js/data/airport-data.js`: the large geometry, airport and runway data
- [x] `js/airports.js`, `js/projection.js`, `js/canvas.js`, `js/seasonal.js`, `js/touch.js`, `js/airport-popup.js`, `js/geodesy.js`, `js/render-loop.js`, `js/terminator.js`, `js/live-layer.js`, `js/telemetry.js`, `js/cutscene.js`, `js/controls.js`: the app logic, cut at its existing section headers
- [x] `index.html` is now markup plus `<script src>` tags in the original order. Classic scripts, not ES modules, so the shared globals work as before.
- [x] Left alone: the Google Fonts link (the app still needs internet for fonts).

**Verification:**
- Reassembling the new files reproduces the original `index.html` byte-for-byte.
- `node --check` passed on every JS file.
- Old and new versions loaded in headless Chromium (390x844 viewport, simulated GPS fix at Orlando, seeded `Math.random`). Zero JS errors, same airport dropdown count (133), 51 state polygons, 128 airports, same function set, and pixel-identical screenshots after the loader faded.
- Not tested: the cutscenes, airport popups and seasonal toggles. The code is byte-identical, so they are expected to work, but nobody has tapped through them yet.

### Build Log 3 (completed): Workflow docs
- [x] Replaced the earlier `docs/build-planner.md` and `docs/build-queue.md` with the three sections in this README.
- [x] `CLAUDE.md` now points to this README and carries the standing rules.

**Verification:** every item from Jon's pasted planner and queue is present below with its wording kept; the `docs/` files are gone.

### Build Log 4 (completed): v63, delete the orphaned zoom-debug comment
The comment described a zoom-level debug readout that no longer exists. Nothing follows it in the markup, and no zoom readout element exists in the HTML, JS or CSS.
- [x] `index.html`: deleted the three-line "DEBUG: current zoom level..." HTML comment (old lines 45-47), under the Reset button block.
- [x] Left alone: the blank line after it, to keep the original spacing.

**Verification:**
- `git diff` shows exactly 3 deletions, all comment lines.
- Old and new versions loaded in headless Chromium at Pixel 7 size (412x915, simulated GPS fix at Orlando, seeded `Math.random`). Zero JS errors, same airport dropdown count (133), 51 state polygons, 128 airports.
- Screenshots were byte-identical on 2 of 3 old-vs-new runs. The unchanged old version also differed from itself on 2 of 3 runs (timing noise in the live plane position), so a difference is not caused by this change.

### Build Log 5 (completed): v64, save the home location between sessions
Promoted from the Build Planner and built as spec'd in the Build Queue (Jon confirmed: save the "Show on map" checkbox too, browser-only storage, reverse the old "deliberately not persisted" decision).
- [x] `js/controls.js`: new `HOME_STORAGE_KEY` (`stratosphere.homeLocation`), `saveHomeLocation()` and `loadHomeLocation()`. The saved JSON is `{lat, lon, show}`: the text of the two input boxes plus the checkbox. If both boxes are empty and the checkbox is unchecked, the key is removed instead.
- [x] `handleHomeLocationChange()` calls `saveHomeLocation()` after updating `STATE.homeLocation`.
- [x] `loadHomeLocation()` runs on `DOMContentLoaded`: refills the boxes and checkbox, then calls `handleHomeLocationChange()` so the existing validation and redraw apply. A missing or unreadable entry does nothing.
- [x] Every storage call is wrapped in `try/catch`, so blocked storage behaves like today.
- [x] Updated the three "not persisted" comments in `js/controls.js`, `js/state.js` and `js/terminator.js`.
- [x] **Bug found during verification (existed in v62):** the render cache's change signature in `draw()` (`js/live-layer.js`) doesn't include the home location, so the 🏠 did not appear after entering or restoring a home location until the view changed (pan, zoom or a toggle). Confirmed in the unmodified v62 code. Fixed with one line in `handleHomeLocationChange()`: `STATE.render.cacheValid = false;`. `js/live-layer.js` was not touched. Jon chose this option over editing the signature.
- [x] Left out, as spec'd: no other settings are saved; no address lookup.

**Verification:** headless Chromium at Pixel 7 size (412x915), simulated GPS fix at Orlando.
- Fresh load: nothing saved, boxes empty, no errors.
- Enter values and check "Show on map": the stored JSON is exactly `{lat, lon, show}`. After a reload, the boxes refill, `STATE` is restored, and the 🏠 is drawn (pixel check against a run with no home).
- Typing at runtime now draws the 🏠 without moving the map, and looks identical to the restored one. Saved with "Show" off: no marker.
- Clear the boxes: the key is removed, and a reload restores nothing.
- Out-of-range latitude (200): restored into the box, no marker, no errors. Corrupt saved value: ignored, no errors. Storage blocked entirely: app loads, home works for the session, no errors.
- Old-vs-new load check with no saved home: zero errors, same airport (133) and state (51) counts. Screenshots were byte-identical on 1 of 3 runs; the unchanged version also differed from itself on 2 of 3 runs earlier (live plane position timing).
- Not tested: a real phone, or a real app relaunch (only page reloads in Chromium). A number box holds an empty value while a lone "-" is typed, so a half-typed "-" is not saved.

### Build Log 6 (completed): v65, "Use my current location" button for the home location
Built as spec'd in the Build Queue, with Jon's decisions: "your defaults", plus one change: ask for confirmation before replacing an existing home location.
- [x] `index.html`: a "📍 Use my current location" button (`btn-home-use-gps`) and a small status line (`home-gps-status`) in the Home Location 🏠 group, between the lat/lon boxes and the "Show on map" checkbox.
- [x] `js/controls.js`: new `useCurrentLocationAsHome()` and `setHomeGpsStatus()`. A one-shot `getCurrentPosition` request with `enableHighAccuracy: true`, `maximumAge: 0` and a 15-second timeout. It is its own request, separate from the app's 3-second GPS polling.
- [x] On success: writes latitude and longitude to 5 decimal places into the boxes, checks "Show on map", then calls `handleHomeLocationChange()` (existing validation, redraw and v64 saving). Status line: "Home set (accuracy ±N m)", or "accuracy unknown".
- [x] While waiting: the button is disabled and the status line reads "Locating…".
- [x] Failures (permission denied, position unavailable, timeout, no geolocation support): the status line says why and ends with "Home not changed." Boxes and saved value are untouched.
- [x] Confirmation: if a home location is already set, a `window.confirm` (no custom dialog existed to reuse) asks "Replace your current home location (old) with your current position (new, accuracy ±N m)?" The prompt appears after the fix arrives, so Jon can decline a poor-accuracy fix. Declining leaves everything unchanged and shows "Home not changed."
- [x] Left alone, as spec'd: the app's existing GPS polling; no address lookup; no background tracking; no CSS changes.

**Verification:** headless Chromium at Pixel 7 size (412x915) with a mocked GPS fix (accuracy 12.4 m).
- Success with no home set: boxes show 28.53830 / -81.37920, Show is checked, `STATE` is set, the value is saved to storage, status reads "Home set (accuracy ±12 m)", no confirm appears, no errors.
- Existing home, declined: the confirm shows the old and new coordinates and the accuracy; boxes, state and status are unchanged. Existing home, accepted: replaced, Show on, saved.
- Permission denied, position unavailable (code 2), timeout (code 3) and no geolocation support each show their message, change nothing and leave the button enabled.
- While waiting, the button is disabled and shows "Locating…"; after the fix it is re-enabled and the home is set.
- The app's existing GPS polling still drives the plane position. The layout was checked in a screenshot of the expanded Settings drawer.
- The v64 persistence and 🏠 marker tests were rerun against the final code: all pass.
- Old-vs-new load check with no saved home: zero errors, same airport (133) and state (51) counts. Screenshots differed by 0 to 291 pixels out of 376,000, in the same small areas (telemetry text and plane) as the unchanged version differs from itself (0 to 193 pixels).
- Not tested: a real phone or a real indoor GPS fix (the GPS was mocked). The Settings drawer scrolls inside its fixed height, so with the new button the "Show on map" checkbox sits slightly lower and needs a small scroll on a phone.

### Build Log 7 (completed): v66, self-host the fonts
Built as spec'd in the Build Queue. Removes the app's only external dependency (the Google Fonts link).
- [x] New `fonts/` folder: `antonio-latin-400-normal.woff2`, `antonio-latin-700-normal.woff2`, `inter-latin-400-normal.woff2`, `inter-latin-600-normal.woff2` (about 70 KB total, Latin subset only), plus `LICENSE-Antonio.txt` and `LICENSE-Inter.txt` (SIL OFL 1.1, as the license requires). Source: the `@fontsource/antonio` and `@fontsource/inter` npm packages, v5.3.0.
- [x] `css/styles.css`: four `@font-face` rules at the very top (`font-display: swap`, `src: url('../fonts/...woff2')`), with a short comment. No other CSS changes.
- [x] `index.html`: removed the Google Fonts `<link>` and the comment line above it. Nothing else changed.
- [x] Left out, as spec'd: no other fonts or weights, no service worker (see Build Queue 1).

**Verification:** headless Chromium at Pixel 7 size (412x915) against a local server, with every host except the local server blocked.
- Zero external requests attempted, zero failed requests, zero JS errors, map ready.
- All four font files were served from `/fonts/` with status 200, and `document.fonts.check` is true for all four faces. Antonio 400, Inter 400 and Inter 600 loaded on page load. Antonio 700 loads on demand: nothing in the UI currently uses bold Antonio, so it was not requested until the test asked for it (the old Google link declared the same weights).
- Checked by eye in screenshots of the main screen and the open Settings drawer: the telemetry readouts render in the condensed Antonio, and labels and buttons render in Inter.
- Coverage check: every non-emoji character the app draws was compared against Google's own subset ranges. `°`, `±`, `—` and `…` are inside the Latin subset. `≡`, `▲`, `▼`, `➢` and `✈` were never in any Google subset for these fonts, so they use the system fallback before and after this change. The data files contain no accented letters.
- The v64 and v65 test suites were rerun against this build: all pass.
- Not compared: pixel-for-pixel against the old version. Earlier test screenshots were taken with Google's fonts blocked, so they used fallback fonts and the text looks different by design. Not tested on a real phone.

### Build Log 8 (completed): v67, offline cache (service worker)
Built as spec'd in the Build Queue, with Jon's decisions: network-first with a 3-second fallback, a 1-hour cache-only window after a failed or timed-out request, background refresh after a slow response, offline cache only (not installable). Jon declined the proposed "end the window when the phone comes back online" idea.
- [x] New `sw.js` in the repo root (scope: the whole site). Same-origin GET requests only. Tries the network with `cache: 'no-cache'` and a 3-second wait; on success it saves a copy in the cache and returns the response; on a timeout or a failed request it returns the saved copy. A page navigation with no copy of that exact URL falls back to the cached `index.html`.
- [x] After one failed or timed-out request the worker serves from the cache only for 1 hour. The "skip until" time is stored as a small cache entry (`network-down-until`), because browsers wipe an idle worker's memory. If nothing is saved for a request, it still tries the network.
- [x] When the 3-second limit fires, the network request keeps running in the background and its result is written to the cache (kept alive with `waitUntil`).
- [x] One cache name constant (`stratosphere-cache-v1`); on activate, caches with any other name are deleted. `skipWaiting()` on install and `clients.claim()` on activate.
- [x] New `js/register-sw.js`, loaded as the last `<script>` in `index.html` (no other script order changes). Registers `sw.js` on window `load`, guarded and with a `.catch`. On a first visit (page not yet controlled) it sends the worker the list of same-origin URLs the page loaded, so they are cached right away without a hand-kept file list.
- [x] Left out, as spec'd: no manifest or icons (Build Planner item 4), no update banner, no background sync, no changes to the app's GPS or home-location code. Fonts needed nothing extra: they are cached like any other file.
- [x] **Behavior to know about (found in testing, not changed because it follows the spec):** after a slow load that hits the 3-second limit, the page itself is refreshed in the cache in the background, but the 1-hour window means the scripts and CSS are not re-requested. The next load inside that hour therefore shows the new page with the older cached scripts, until the hour ends or the network answers a load normally. This needs an update pushed just before a slow load, and a reload does not clear it for up to an hour.

**Verification:** headless Chromium at Pixel 7 size (412x915) against a local test server that sent `cache-control: max-age=600` like GitHub Pages, and could hang, go down, or serve a changed file.
- First visit online: all 25 files the page loaded (HTML, CSS, 20 scripts, 3 fonts) were in the cache, the worker was active, and nothing external was requested. The browser's automatic `favicon.ico` request returns a 404 and is not cached.
- Server unreachable: the page, map and loader load from the cache with zero JS errors, the saved home location restores, and a URL with a query string also loads. The failure set the 1-hour window (about 60 minutes left).
- Update: with a changed `index.html` and a changed script on the server, one normal reload showed both new versions even with the 10-minute `max-age`, and the worker revalidated with the server.
- Hanging server (connected, no internet): the page loaded from the cache after about 3.5 seconds; the next load inside the hour took about 0.6 seconds and made zero server requests; after rewriting the stored time into the past, the network was tried again and the update arrived.
- Slow server (answers after 4.5 seconds): that load showed the saved page, and the page was refreshed in the cache in the background (this also showed the behavior noted above).
- Service workers blocked, and a browser with no service worker support: the app loads normally with no errors.
- The v64, v65 and v66 test suites were rerun against this build: all pass.
- Live GitHub Pages site (checked after the deploy, headless Chromium at Pixel 7 size): the worker registered with the site scope and activated; the first visit filled the cache with 25 entries (the page, the CSS, 20 scripts, 3 fonts); no JS errors and nothing requested outside the site. With the network fully switched off, a reload loaded the app from the cache in about 30 ms, the loader faded, the saved home location came back and the 🏠 drew.
- Not tested: a real phone, or real airplane Wi-Fi.

### Build Log 9 (completed): v68, fix a stale comment about the cutscene runway color
Built as spec'd in the Build Queue. Comment-only change: no code or behavior touched.
- [x] `css/styles.css`, line 242 (the last line of the `BUG FIX` comment on `#cutscene-runway-dashes`): `black` changed to `grey`, so it reads `centerline on solid grey pavement */`.
- [x] Left alone, as spec'd: the earlier line in the same comment ("alternate solid black/white bars"), which describes how the old bug looked. No other file or line changed.

**Verification:**
- `git diff` shows exactly one changed line (one removed, one added), inside a comment.
- Headless Chromium at Pixel 7 size (412x915): zero JS errors, and the takeoff cutscene's runway still renders `rgb(117, 117, 117)` (`#757575`).
- The page-load part of the fonts test was rerun: passes.

## Build Queue

Fully specified work that is waiting for a go-ahead. Items leave this list in the same commit that builds them.

### 1. Remove Wyoming's dead-time season
**Not yet authorized to build.**

Promoted from the Build Planner (Wyoming's dates). Jon's reason: Wyoming typically goes straight from fall colors to snow cover overnight. Jon chose option 1: the switch happens on Oct 11, when snow starts, and snow's start date does not move.

- Where: `js/seasonal.js`, the `"Wyoming"` entry in the state season data.
- What: change `dead: [[10,21],[12,1]]` to `dead: null` on that one line, the same way other states with no dead-time are written. The result is `seasons: { fall: [[9,21],[10,20]], dead: null, snow: [[10,11],[4,20]], spring: [[4,21],[6,30]] }`.
- Behavior after: Sep 21 to Oct 10 fall; Oct 11 to Apr 20 snow (no brown stretch in between); Apr 21 to Jun 30 spring; Jul 1 to Sep 20 no season (the plain default land color, as before). The picker gives the window that started most recently priority, so fall's nominal end of Oct 20 stays overridden by snow from Oct 11, exactly as it is today.
- Not included: fall, snow and spring dates are unchanged; no other state is touched; no code changes.
- Test plan: `git diff` shows exactly one changed line, in `js/seasonal.js`; in the page, check `getActiveSeasonColors('Wyoming', date)` for Sep 20, Sep 21, Oct 10, Oct 11, Oct 20, Oct 21, Nov 15, Dec 2, Apr 20, Apr 21, Jun 30 and Jul 1, and confirm no date in the whole year returns the dead-time season for Wyoming; compare every day of the year for all other states against the previous version and confirm nothing else changed; load check at Pixel 7 size (412x915) with zero errors.
- Ships as: v69.

### 2. Installable app (manifest and icons)
**Not yet authorized to build.**

Promoted from the Build Planner (installable app). Jon chose the icon (his globe image, with the fake transparency removed and the edge cleaned up) and said "your defaults" for everything else. Android and iPhone. Jon also asked for a browser-tab favicon from the same artwork and chose to fold it into this item (one build, one `<head>` edit).

- Icon files, new `icons/` folder, made from Jon's globe image (503x543 JPEG; the globe itself is 386 px across). The globe is cut out with a truly transparent background and a smooth circular edge (fitted circle: center 247, 292.5 and radius 190.5 in the source image).
  - `icons/icon-192.png` and `icons/icon-512.png`: Android, transparent, globe at 94% of the canvas.
  - `icons/icon-maskable-512.png`: Android adaptive icon, opaque, globe at 70% of the canvas (inside the 80% safe circle) on a deep-navy radial gradient (center `#17407a`, edge `#050b1c`) with a soft shadow under the globe.
  - `icons/apple-touch-icon-180.png`: iPhone, opaque (iOS shows transparency as black), same backdrop, globe at 76%. iOS rounds the corners itself.
- Favicon: one `favicon.ico` in the repo root with 16, 32 and 48 px versions, each scaled from the cropped transparent globe (not from the small, pixelated JPEG Jon sent, which is 273x271 with a white square and ring baked in). Transparent corners. At 16 px the plane and state lines blur into a blue globe with a pale patch; that is expected for a favicon.
- New `manifest.webmanifest` in the repo root: `name` and `short_name` both "Stratosphere"; `description` "Track your in-flight status"; `start_url` and `scope` `./`; `display` `standalone`; `background_color` and `theme_color` both `#0d0e12` (the night-mode page background); `icons`: the 192 and 512 files as `any` and the maskable 512 as `maskable`. No `orientation` entry *(my default)*, so rotation behaves as it does in the browser today.
- `index.html` `<head>`: add `<link rel="manifest" href="manifest.webmanifest">`, `<meta name="theme-color" content="#0d0e12">`, `<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="icons/apple-touch-icon-180.png">`, `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">` and `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-title" content="Stratosphere">`, and `<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" sizes="any">`. Nothing else in the file changes. No iOS status-bar-style tag *(my default)*, so iOS keeps its normal status bar.
- Not included: no orientation lock; no theme color that changes with day or night mode; no in-app "Install" button; no iOS splash screens; no 1024 px App Store icon (the source image is too small for a sharp one); no app code changes.
- Source files: the icon PNGs and `favicon.ico` were made in this session's scratch folder, which does not survive the session. If this is built in a later session, Jon re-supplies the five PNGs (he downloaded them) or the original globe image, and everything is rebuilt with the recipe above.
- Test plan, at Pixel 7 size (412x915) against a local server: `manifest.webmanifest` is valid JSON and every icon path in it returns 200 with the right type; each PNG has the size it claims; `favicon.ico` holds exactly the 16, 32 and 48 px images with transparent corners and the page requests it with a 200; the maskable and Apple icons are fully opaque and the 192/512 icons have transparent corners; Chrome's own installability check (DevTools protocol `Page.getInstallabilityErrors`) reports no errors and `Page.getAppManifest` parses the manifest with no warnings; the page loads with zero JS errors and the existing offline cache, home-location, fonts and button suites still pass. After the push, repeat the installability check on the live GitHub Pages site and confirm the icons load there. Jon then tries "Install app" from Chrome's menu on his phone.
- Ships as: v70.

## Build Planner

Ideas and known gaps with no committed design yet. Resolved, built, dropped or superseded items are deleted from here, and their history lives in the Build Log.

### Surfaced in earlier sessions
1. **GPS-noise tuning after your flight test:** 60 ft lateral margin,
   150 ft along-track margin, 7° alignment, 50 mph threshold.
   Waiting on real-world results from the GPS-loss flight test. The 60 ft
   lateral margin, 150 ft along-track margin and 7° alignment are the
   values to watch.
2. **Track-Up mode never gets the idle-snapshot caching:** a limitation,
   not a regression
